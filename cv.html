        <li>I am a lecturer in Computer Science department, Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University, Egypt.</li><br>
        <li>Previously I was a PhD fellowship student at the Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division (CEMSE) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. I obtained my PhD degree in 2017 in manipulating very large string databases.</li><br>
        <li>Previously I worked as a teaching assistant at Computer Science department, Faculty of Computers and Information. I got bachelor degree in Computers and Information at 2003 from this institution with excellent grade, being first of my class, with 94.5%. Then, I got Master's degree titled "An Arabic-Disambiguating Engine Based on Statistical Approaches" in Computer Science from the same institution at 2008.</li><br>
        <li>I have great experience in algorithms and problem solving. I am interested heavily in basic computer science subjects, such as: Algorithms, Data structures, Probability, and Artificial Intelligence. I am fond of solving problems using exact and approximate algorithms, using fast optimized C++ programs.</li><br>
        <li>I have participated in many algorithmic programming contests. The first famous contest in which I got the first place is the Programmer of the Month (POTM) contest (May 2005). I also managed to advance to the ACM-ICPC World Finals (2006). I am high ranked member in Topcoder Marathon Matches algorithmic contests, in which I get advanced places. Two of these remarkable contests are AMD Multicore Threadfest 1 contest (2008) and CUDA Superhero Challenge 2 (2009). Recently, I got the first place in ACM SIGMOD Programming Contest (2012) and the second place in AstraZeneca-Sanger Drug Combination Prediction DREAM Challenge 1B (2016).</li><br>
