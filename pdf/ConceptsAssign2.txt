* The total number of written lines must not exceed 70 lines.
* The hand-written version must be written by your hands, not using any text-editing software.
* Make a photocopy of the hand-written version and keep it with you all the time during the lectures.
* The doctor may discuss with you, at any time he prefers after 12 May, the photocopy existing with you.
* Write your name, your ID, your group, your lab slot time, and the language you have chosen at the top of the paper.
* Make an electronic .txt version of the paper which is the same as the hand-written version.
* Encode the electronic version using the method below.
* Submit the encoded electronic version on the Google Forms link by 12 May.
* Deliver and discuss the hand-written paper with the TA during your lab of the week starting at 13 May.
* You must attend your lab slot, not any other lab slot.
* You are not allowed to deliver an assignment on behalf of any other student.
* You are allowed to choose a programming languge which differs from the language you chose in assignment 1.

The encoding method:
* Write your report in exactly one text file such as myfile.txt.
* You must not include any TAB character in your report. Write 4 spaces in place of each TAB.
* Make sure that myfile.txt contains the actual submission, for example open it in Notepad.
* Encode the file using the assign_encoder tool as the following:
g++ -O3 -o assign_encoder.exe assign_encoder.cpp
assign_encoder.exe ./myfile.txt 2 1 20101111
* Replace the last number above with your student ID.
* Open the resulting assign_2_20101111.bin file in a text editor.
* Make sure that the text-editor did not put any line-breaks (un-check the word-wrap option).
* Copy all the text included in the file.
* Sign-in using your Google email account.
* Paste the text in the dedicated Google Survey link, as well as your ID.
